# MUSA 650 - Geospatial Machine Learning in Remote Sensing 

## Scheduling

### Class

Monday from 10:15AM to 1:15PM

- Jan 12 to Jan 24:  Online on Zoom (Online class links will be announced weekly on Piazza and GitHub pages of the class)
- After Jan 24:      In person

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.

## Course Description

Satellite remote sensing is the science of converting raw aerial imagery into actionable intelligence about the built and natural environment. This course will provide students the foundation necessary for application of machine learning algorithms on satellite imagery. Use cases include building footprint detection, multi-class object detection in cities and land cover/land use classification. The students will learn basic concepts of machine learning, including unsupervised and supervised learning, model selection, feature elimination, cross-validation and performance evaluation. After learning traditional methods and algorithms, the course will focus on recent deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks and their application on semantic image segmentation.

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to  be familiar with and comply with Pennâ€™s Code of Academic Integrity, which is available online at https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity . Any form of academic dishonesty will be penalized with a failing grade for the assignment in which the infringement occurred. Additionally, any violations of the Code will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct for further disciplinary action.

## About the course

The main learning goal of this class is to provide students essential knowledge and skills in applied machine learning. This will be done through hands-on applications and a large number of practical examples. While the class will cover general concepts of machine learning, applications will specifically focus on use cases in remote sensing. There will be a specific focus on deep learning applications, as deep learning is becoming an essential framework in machine learning, with state-of-the-art performance. The students will learn how to define a problem, select appropriate algorithms and tools, design and implement their machine learning models, and apply and validate their models on new datasets. This is a hands-on class involving multiple examples that will be explained and run real-time during the lectures. Active participation on Google Colab is highly recommended both during and out of lecture times.

## Grading: 

The grading breakdown is as follows: 50% for homework, 40% for project and 10% for participation. Homework and project grade is not directly linked to accuracy of the final applications. Multiple factors, including data organization, model selection and presentation of the results will be evaluated.

Homework assignments will involve implementation of machine learning applications using toy datasets provided by the instructor. Homework is assigned before the close of each class and is due at the end of the following week's class. Late homework will be accepted but penalized. Students are encouraged to work in groups, but they must submit a homework assignment that is uniquely theirs.

For the term project, students are expected to make their own research to select a machine learning problem in remote sensing, collect and organize their datasets, and implement their solution, working in groups or individually.

Students are encouraged to ask and answer questions on Piazza. Participation grade is a function of both in-class and Piazza participation.

## Software

This course relies on use of Python and various related packages. The class will include interactive demonstrations on Google Colab. All software is open-source and freely available.
